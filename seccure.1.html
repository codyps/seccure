<h2>Description</h2>


<p>The <b>seccure</b> toolset implements a selection of asymmetric 
algorithms based on elliptic
curve cryptography (ECC). In particular it offers public key encryption /
decryption and signature generation / verification.
</p>
<p>
ECC schemes offer a much better key size to security ratio than
classical systems (RSA, DSA). Keys are short enough to make direct
specification of keys on the command line possible (sometimes this is
more convenient than the management of PGP-like key rings).
<b>seccure</b> builds on this feature and therefore is the tool of
choice whenever lightweight asymmetric cryptography --
independent of key servers, revocation certificates, the Web of Trust
or even configuration files --  is required.
</p>





<h2>Commands</h2>

      <p><b>seccure-key</b>: Prompt for a passphrase and
      calculate the corresponding public key.</p>
      
      <p><b>seccure-encrypt</b>: Encrypt a message with 
      public key <em>key</em>.</p>

      <p><b>seccure-decrypt</b>: Prompt for a passphrase
      and decrypt a 
      <b>seccure-encrypt</b>ed message.</p>

      <p><b>seccure-sign</b>: Prompt for a passphrase and
      digitally sign a message.</p>

      <p><b>seccure-verify</b>: Verify signature <em>sig</em>
      with public key <em>key</em>.</p>

      



<h2>Options</h2>


      
<p><b>-c <em>curve</em></b></p> 

 <p>Use elliptic curve <em>curve</em>. Available are:
<em>secp112r1</em>, <em>secp128r1</em>, <em>secp160r1</em>,
<em>secp192r1/nistp192</em>, <em>secp224r1/nistp224</em>,
<em>secp256r1/nistp256</em>, <em>secp384r1/nistp384</em> and
<em>secp521r1/nistp521</em>.  The curve name may be abbreviated by
any non-ambiguous substring (for instance it is suggested to specify
<em>p224</em> for the <em>secp224r1/nistp224</em> curve). The
default curve is <em>p160</em>, which provides reasonable security
for everyday use. (See also <b>HOW TO CHOOSE THE
CURVE</b>.)</p>


      
<p><b>-F <em>pwfile</em></b></p>

      <p>Don't prompt for a passphrase; instead, take the first text
  line of <em>pwfile</em>.</p>

      
      
      <p><b>-m <em>maclen</em></b></p>

      <p>Set the MAC length to <em>maclen</em> bits. Only multiples
of 8 in the range from 0 to 256 are allowed. The default MAC length is
80 bits, which provides a reasonable level of integrity protection for
everyday use.</p>


      
      
      <p><b>-i <em>infile</em></b></p>

      <p>
Read from <em>infile</em> instead of STDIN.
</p>

      
      <p><b>-o <em>outfile</em></b></p>

      <p>
Write to <em>outfile</em> instead of STDOUT.
</p>

      
      <p><b>-s <em>sigfile</em></b></p>


      <p>For <b>seccure-sign</b>: Write signature to
<em>sigfile</em> instead of STDERR. </p>

<p>For <b>seccure-verify</b>: Read signature from
<em>sigfile</em> instead of using <em>sig</em>.
</p>

      

      <p><b>-f</b></p>

      <p>Filter mode: Copy all data read from STDIN verbatim to STDOUT.</p>


      
      <p><b>-b</b></p>

      <p>Binary mode: Read/write signatures as binary strings. This
      leads to very compact signatures.</p>

      

      <p><b>-v</b></p>

      <p>Verbose mode: Print some extra information.</p>

      

      <p><b>-q</b></p>

      <p>Quiet mode: Disable all unnecessary output.</p>

      



<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Given the passphrase 'seccure is secure', run</p> 
<p><b>seccure-key</b></p> 

<p>to determine the corresponding public key (which is
'2@DupCaCKykHBe-QHpAP%d%B[' on curve <em>p160</em>).</p>

<p>To encrypt the file 'document.msg' with that key run</p>

<p><b>seccure-encrypt -i document.msg -o document.enc '2@DupCaCKykHBe-QHpAP%d%B['</b></p>

<p>The message can be recovered with </p>

<p><b>seccure-decrypt -i document.enc</b></p>

<p>To sign the file run</p>

<p><b>seccure-sign -i document.msg -s document.sig</b></p>

<p>and enter the passphrase. The signature is 
stored in 'document.sig' and can be verified with
</p>

<p><b>seccure-verify -i document.msg -s document.sig
'2@DupCaCKykHBe-QHpAP%d%B['</b></p>


<h2>How to choose the curve</h2>

<p>
The number in the names of the curves measures their security level.
Rule of thumb: the workload to 'break' a k-bit curve is 2^(k/2)
approximately (example: it takes about 2^112 steps to break
<em>secp224r1</em>). If the 80 bit security of the default curve
doesn't seem sufficient, choosing a stronger curve (<em>p192</em>
and upwards) may, of course, be considered. But the suggestion
remains: <em>p160</em> offers reasonable security for everyday use.
<b>Warning:</b> the curves <em>p112</em> and <em>p128</em> do
not satisfy demands for long-time security.
</p>






<h2>Algorithms</h2>

<p>
<b>seccure</b> uses derivated versions of the ECIES (Elliptic
Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme) and the ECDSA (Elliptic Curve
Digital Signature Standard) as encryption and signature scheme,
respectively. For the symmetric parts (bulk encryption, hashing, key
derivation, HMAC calculation) <b>seccure</b> builds on AES256 (in
CTR mode), SHA256 and SHA512.
</p>



<h2>Known Limitations</h2>

<p>
<b>seccure</b> doesn't support "Vollbit Verschluesselung" yet! ;-)
