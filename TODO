- make use of libgcrypt's capabilities to allocate and manage secure
   memory. Memlocking everything -- this is what we are doing now --
   is a bit overkill, perhaps.

- implement a key establishment scheme (DH at least, perhaps also an
  authenticated scheme). This needs a certain kind of user interaction.

- implement a signcryption scheme. Is there a (non-patented) standard
   for this?
  
- speed up the point multiplication routines using NAF or wNAF techniques.
