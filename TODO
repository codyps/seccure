- make use of libgcrypt's capabilities to allocate and manage secure
   memory. Memlocking everything -- this is what we are doing now --

- implement an authenticated key establishment scheme. STS, IKE, MQV?

- implement a signcryption scheme. Which one?
  
- speed up the point multiplication routines using NAF or wNAF techniques.
